# Car Loan Calculator

This Python program uses Google Sheets to calculate and analyze the financial aspects of
a car loan. It takes user input for parameters such as price of the car, monthly wage,
car make, financing duration and expected interest. 
The calculated results, including monthly costs and affordability, are then stored in a Google Spreadsheet
